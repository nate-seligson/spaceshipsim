# spaceshipsim || November 2022

Small video game where you fly around in a spaceship and destory asteroids and NPCs. The NPCs have small-scale AI and multiple unique death animations.

This game was created to help me learn Unity particle systems, enemy AI, game design, Coroutines, and camera control.
